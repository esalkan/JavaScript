/**
 * DECLARE STRING VARIABLES
 * 
 * Previously we used the following code to declare a variable:
 */

var myName;

/**
 * But we can olso declare a string variable like below:
 */

var myName = "alkan";

/**
 * "alkan" is called a string literal. A string literal, or string, is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
 */

// Create two new string variables: "myFirstName" and "myLastName" and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.

var myFirstName = "ES";
var myLastName = "ALKAN"
